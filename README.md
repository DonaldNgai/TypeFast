# TypeFast
##Synopsis
The object of this game is to type the word displayed on the screen as quickly as possible.

##Usage
A live demo of this application can be found at http://donald-ngai.com/Games/TypeFast/typeGame.html

##Motivation
In addition to my "Flippy" game, I realized the value in incorporating multiplayer features into my games. Therefore, in order to gain insight into the working of a multiplayer game, I created this application which allows users to communicate via a chatbox in real time and keeps track of real time high scores which get updated for all users.
